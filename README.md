# Vahab Vahabov | Backend Developer  

**I am a self-driven and detail-oriented developer with a growing expertise in Java and backend development.**  
Over the past months, I have consistently worked on improving my programming skills by developing real-world applications â€” including a fully functional personal website built with **Java (Spring Boot)**, **REST APIs**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**. This experience has strengthened my understanding of **web technologies** and **software architecture**.  

In addition to Java, I also have practical experience with **Python** and basic frontend tools such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Thymeleaf**.  
I approach programming with a **problem-solving mindset** and a **strong desire to learn and improve continuously**. I enjoy combining both backend logic and user-facing interfaces to build complete, responsive applications.  

As I continue my journey, I aim to deepen my knowledge of **scalable system design**, **clean code principles**, and **modern development practices**, while collaborating with others and contributing to meaningful projects.
